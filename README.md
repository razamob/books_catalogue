# books_catalogue
A tkinter application that stores books' information in database

The program has two script files. One for the backend and one for the front end. The backend has the CRUD methods.The script also connects to the sqlite database.
The frontend script creates the GUI and connects the frontend to the backend. 
Each button is connected to the appropriate method in the backend.

An executable file was also created for the program, as it will allow anyone to run the program without python installed.
